Tero is an opinionated Terraform framework designed to standardize infrastructure as code across your organization. It provides reusable modules, standardized configurations, and best practices enforcement - similar to how React provides structure for JavaScript applications.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Terraform >= 1.5.0
- AWS CLI configured
- Git

### Initialize Project
```bash

mkdir my-enterprise-infra && cd my-enterprise-infra

# Clone Tero core library
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tero.git lib

# Initialize starter template
cp -r lib/templates/standard-project/* .
```

### Deploy Foundation
```hcl
# main.tf
module "network" {
  source = "lib/modules/networking/vpc"

  name       = "core-network"
  cidr_block = "10.100.0.0/20"
  env        = "prod"
  azs        = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
}

module "security" {
  source = "lib/modules/security/baseline"

  vpc_id = module.network.vpc_id
}
```

### Apply Configuration
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
terraform output vpc_id
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --vpc-ids $(terraform output -raw vpc_id)
```
