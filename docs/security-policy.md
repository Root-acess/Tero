# Tero Security Policy

This document outlines the security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and compliance features of the Tero Framework.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

Tero embeds security at every layer to ensure compliance and protection:

- **Automated Secret Scanning**: Detects and prevents hard-coded credentials in configurations.
- **Infrastructure Drift Detection**: Identifies unauthorized changes to deployed resources.
- **CIS Benchmark Compliance**: Modules adhere to Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: KMS integration for data at rest and in transit.
- **Audit Logging**: Integrates with CloudTrail (AWS), Activity Log (Azure), or Cloud Logging (GCP) for full auditability.

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

To report a security vulnerability:
1. Email [security@your-org.com](mailto:security@your-org.com).
2. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
   - Affected module or component.
3. Expect an acknowledgment within 24 hours.
4. Our team will investigate and provide updates within 72 hours.

**Do not** disclose vulnerabilities publicly until they are resolved and approved for release.

## üîê Security Practices

- **Least Privilege**: IAM roles and policies are generated with minimal permissions using the `security/baseline` module.
- **Encryption**: All data storage (S3, RDS, etc.) uses KMS or equivalent encryption by default.
- **Network Security**: Security groups and network ACLs restrict traffic to necessary ports and IPs.
- **Compliance**: Modules are pre-configured for SOC2 and CIS compliance.
- **Secrets Management**: Use AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Secret Manager instead of hardcoding secrets.

Example security group configuration:
```hcl
module "security" {
  source = "lib/modules/security/baseline"
  vpc_id = module.network.vpc_id
  env    = "prod"
}
```

## üîç Monitoring and Response

- **Drift Detection**: Run `terraform plan` regularly to detect unauthorized changes.
- **Logging**: Enable audit logging via CloudTrail or equivalent.
- **Alerts**: Configure alerts for unauthorized access or configuration changes using your cloud provider‚Äôs monitoring tools.

## üìú Compliance Certifications

Tero modules are designed to support:
- SOC2 Type II
- CIS Benchmarks for AWS, Azure, and GCP
- GDPR (data encryption and access controls)
